# **CITS2002 WS6**
Repo was made so I could experiment doing a project whilst also uploading (in stages), the project to github. You can find the project [Here](https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/workshops/workshop6.php).

## **How**
This was done through:

1. Incremental additions
2. Incremental Commits
3. Long times between pushes
